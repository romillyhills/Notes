	I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Feo Kusmartsev for his help and guidance during my PhD, he has always provided a new topic or insight to forward my work. I would also like to thank the physics department at Loughborough University for the funding and opportunity to spend time researching into graphene. Finally, I would like to thank all the attendees of the graphene meetings in the Loughborough physics department who provided a forum to freely discuss ideas and offered feedback on the work presented.
